## Solution made by Tilocca Salvatore s305938 
In this solution I proposed an evolutionary algorithm with early stop that continues until the best fitness of the population converges with a range of 0.04 (see figure), the number of samples needed to have a convergence is the parameter of the function find_best_fitness called early_stopping (default=1000).

Each Offspring is generated by either mutation or crossover
### I have proposed 3 different possible Crossovers:
- one cut
- two point crossover
- Uniform crossover



Each crossover is picked randomly

## Results
### Fitness value

| 1 Problem instances | 2 Problem instances |  5 Problem instances | 10 Problem instances |
|-----|-----|---------------|--------------|
| 1.  | 0.756  |       0.37      | 0.30|

### Fitness calls
The number of fitness calls depends on the convergence range that is defined, these values refer to a range of 0.04,this is the range_convergence parameter of the function ''' find_best_fitness ''' so it can be tested with other values

| 1 Problem instances | 2 Problem instances |  5 Problem instances | 10 Problem instances |
|-----|-----|---------------|--------------|
| 20140   | 23380   |       20520      | 21280|
